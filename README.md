# Example React

This is a minimal React example for integrating with Boatshed.

To get started you will need to:

1. Update client variables in `app/src/App.js`
2. Update the server variables in `server/index.js`
3. Start the React app `cd app && yarn start`
4. Start the Node server `cd server && node index.js`
